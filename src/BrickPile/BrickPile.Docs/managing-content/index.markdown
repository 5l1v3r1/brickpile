#Managing Content
BrickPile lets you manage and write content in an intuitive and easy way. The content is managed in the back office and each page will get it's own unique URL.
The organization of the pages will control your site's URLs.

For example if you create a page at the top level called **Contact Us**, you automaticly have a `www.example.com/contact-us/` URL on your site. You can add as many sub pages as you'd like.

##Automatic Navigation
Your pages can be used to automaticly create your [navigation](../how-brickpile-works). Simply drag'n drop your pages to indicate how you'd like your nav ordered.
###Hiding Content
If you'd like to "hide" a page from the navigation, simply uncheck the the "Visible in menu" checkbox and it will be removed.
###Publish Content
If you are working on a page's content and don't want the page to be accessible before it's done, you can uncheck the "Published" checkbox and it will also be removed and made inaccessible for your visitors.
