{"name":"BrickPile CMS","tagline":"BrickPile is an open source content management system built on RavenDB and ASP.NET MVC 4.","body":"#BrickPile is a lightweight CMS built on RavenDB and ASP.NET MVC 4.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n### Brace yourself, BrickPile makes the following demands:\r\n* ASP.NET MVC 4\r\n* [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/)\r\n\r\n**And that's about it.** A slight bit of knowledge about ASP.NET MVC development is also required.\r\n##Installing\r\n###Getting Installed\r\nInstalling BrickPile is simply the act of writing a single PowerShell command inside the package manager console.\r\n\r\n  PM> Install-Package BrickPile -Pre\r\n\r\n**And that's basically it.** Of course you need an empty ASP.NET MVC 4 web application.\r\n\r\n##Configuration\r\nAs default BrickPile will run RavenDB in embedded mode and store the documents in `~\\App_Data\\Raven`. This can easily be configured to use an other location or RavenDB server. The following example shows how to use RavenDB server.\r\n\r\n\t<connectionStrings>\r\n\t\t<add name=\"RavenDB\" connectionString=\"Url = http://localhost:8080\" />\r\n\t</connectionStrings>\r\n\r\n**Note:** To run BrickPile with RavenDB server you need to [download](http://ravendb.net/download) it and execute `[RavenDBdir]\\Server\\Raven.Server.exe`. For more configuration options see [RavenDB documentation](http://ravendb.net/documentation).\r\n\r\n### Assets configuration\r\nIn order to use Assets you have to change two things.\r\nIn `Global.asax`, add:\r\n`HostingEnvironment.RegisterVirtualPathProvider(new NativeVirtualPathProvider());`\r\n\r\nAnd then make sure that your `web.config` has the correct PhysicalPath and that the directory exist:\r\n\r\n        <appSettings>\r\n             <add key=\"PhysicalPath\" value=\"C:\\temp\\static\\\" />\r\n        </appSettings>\r\n\r\n**Note:** The PhysicalPath can also be relative to the site root like this `~/App_Data/Static`\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\nWhen the configuration is done just hit `F5` inside Visual Studio, this will hopefully bring up the setup screen.\r\nFill the form with the correct information and hit \"Let's do this\" and your done.\r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
